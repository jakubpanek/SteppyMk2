# Steppy Mk2

The goal of this project is to create a versatile robotic platform for robotic competitions.

It started with a very primitive PCB design that featured just a few, mostly through-hole components and evolved into a much more complicated design with over a hundred SMD components.

## Main features:
NXP's FRDM dev boards, Arduino compatibility
Two NEMA8 stepper motors
Fits onto 100x100mm PCB for cheap manufacturing
RGB LEDs
OLED display
Joystick
Buzzer
IÂ²C battery voltage sensor
Interchangeable sensor board
